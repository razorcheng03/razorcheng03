## Hi there 👋

I build things because curiosity doesn’t let me sleep.

Most of my projects start as questions, small annoyances, or “what if?” moments —
and turn into code that actually does something useful.

I care about:
• clarity over cleverness  
• progress over perfection  
• learning by building  

This profile is a collection of experiments, lessons, half-polished ideas,
and the occasional project that turned out better than expected.
